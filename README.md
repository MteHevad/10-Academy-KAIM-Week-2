README: User Analysis Project
This README file provides guidance on completing the various tasks associated with the User Overview, User Engagement, Experience Analytics, and Satisfaction Analysis for a telecom dataset.
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior, engagement, and experience using a telecom dataset. The analysis aims to provide insights into user behavior, engagement patterns, and overall customer satisfaction. The tasks are divided into four main sections:

User Overview Analysis
User Engagement Analysis
Experience Analytics
Dashboard Development & Satisfaction Analysis
Task Details
Task 1: User Overview Analysis
Conduct a full user overview analysis to understand customer behavior and identify key insights for marketing and business development.

Identify Top Handsets and Manufacturers:

Determine the top 10 handsets used by customers.
Identify the top 3 handset manufacturers.
Identify the top 5 handsets for each of the top 3 manufacturers.
Provide recommendations to marketing teams based on findings.
Analyze User Behavior on Applications:

Aggregate the number of sessions, session duration, total download (DL), upload (UL), and total data volume for each application.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, identify missing values, and detect outliers.
Segment users into decile classes and compute total data per class.
Analyze metrics such as mean, median, and dispersion.
Perform correlation and dimensionality reduction analysis.
Task 2: User Engagement Analysis
Analyze user engagement by tracking activities on applications and metrics like session frequency, duration, and traffic.

Aggregate Engagement Metrics:
Aggregate session frequency, duration, and traffic per user.
Normalize engagement metrics and apply k-means clustering (k=3).
Compute summary statistics (min, max, average, total) for each cluster.
Plot the most used applications and interpret results.
Determine the optimal value of k using the elbow method.
Task 3: Experience Analytics
Conduct an in-depth analysis of user experience based on network parameters and device characteristics.

Aggregate User Experience Metrics:

Compute average TCP retransmission, RTT, handset type, and throughput per user.
List the top, bottom, and most frequent values for TCP, RTT, and throughput.
Analyze distribution and provide interpretations.
Clustering Analysis:
Perform k-means clustering (k=3) on experience metrics.
Describe each cluster based on user experience data.
Task 4: Dashboard Development & Satisfaction Analysis
Develop a dashboard and analyze customer satisfaction based on user engagement and experience scores.
Dashboard Development:
Design a dashboard using visualization tools to display key insights.
Ensure the dashboard meets usability, interactivity, visual appeal, and deployment success criteria.
Satisfaction Analysis:
Assign engagement and experience scores to users using Euclidean distance.
Compute satisfaction scores and identify the top 10 satisfied customers.
Build a regression model to predict satisfaction scores.
Perform clustering analysis on engagement and experience scores.
Export final results to a MySQL database.
Tools and Libraries Required
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
scikit-learn (for clustering and regression)
SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
Docker or MLOps tools (for model deployment and tracking)
Visualization Tools:
Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries like Plotly or Dash
Database:
MySQL
